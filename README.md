### Hi there
<p>
I am a software engineer with a strong interest in data science (deep learning, in particular). I enjoy working with JavaScript (React), Flutter and Python. I love Haskell, and if the plane carrying all the Haskell programmers were going down, I would want to be on it.
</p>
<p>
I have taken quite a lot of machine learning and deep learning models to production in various domains while heading data science teams. I have designed curriculum for data science/deep learning programs/workshops for universities and one edtech startup.
